# Secure-website-with-SSL-and-CDN
Security and performance are two important aspects of modern web applications. 


In this project I'm focused on deploying secure and optimized web applications using SSL encryption and a content delivery network (CDN). 

Here's how I implemented the solution. 

Main components: SSL Certificate: I use Let's Encrypt to install a free SSL certificate for my web server. 

This ensures that all data between the client and server is encrypted and secured with HTTPS... 

Web Application Deployment: The web application is deployed on a cloud platform AWS EC2 and configured to serve content over HTTPS. 

Cloudflare CDN (or equivalent): I integrate Cloudflare (or similar CDN provider) to store static content such as image files, CSS, and JavaScript. The CDN reduces latency and speeds up content delivery. also users especially to audiences around the world Security Headers : Add additional HTTP security headers (such as HSTS, Content Security Policy, etc.) to increase the security level of web applications. 

Why it's important: Securing your website with SSL and optimizing it through CDN are essential practices for modern web applications. SSL ensures that sensitive data is transmitted securely, while CDN improves speed and reliability. The reliability of content delivery is very high. This is especially true for users who are far from the origin server. This project demonstrates the critical skills that solution architects need to ensure security. reliability and cloud application performance
